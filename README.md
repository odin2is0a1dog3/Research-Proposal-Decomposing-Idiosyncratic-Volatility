## Abstract
This document outlines a research proposal to investigate the idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) puzzle, a cornerstone of behavioral finance. We leverage a long-history dataset of daily open, high, low, and close (OHLC) prices to decompose IVOL into its intraday and overnight components. The central hypothesis is that the anomalously low returns associated with high IVOL are driven primarily by high **intraday** volatility—a proxy for speculative activity—while overnight volatility, which is more related to the processing of fundamental news, carries a different or insignificant risk premium.  
This research aims to refine the “lottery-like” stock explanation for the IVOL anomaly (Barberis & Huang, 2008) and provide a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes “good” versus “bad” volatility.
